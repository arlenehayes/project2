	  <p>First, a brief background. I originate from Grenada, an island in the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean, where I attended school up to tertiary level at the local community college. I now attend the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois after having gained two years of work experience at a design and construction firm back home in Grenada. I am currently pursuing a professional Bachelor's degree in Architecture. 
      By way of hobbies, I enjoy dance and the performing arts on a whole. I am a member of Conception Dance Theatre Grenada, a modern-, ballet- and Caribbean folk-oriented dance company.
	  As a steadily maturing student of Architecture and dance, I would love to find a way to integrate the two of them and hence find myself greatly interested in the idea of Theatre Design. 
	  The long term goal is to develop myself as a designer and eventually become a project manager versatile in both design/construction and stage art. Short term, I am interested in internship positions with architecture firms in and around Chicago to develop my skills and work ethic. I am also seeking opportunities to study abroad where I can experience new cultures and come away with a greater appreciation of world architecture and art practices.</p>
